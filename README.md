## Hello there👋, I am Narendra Bandineni 🤗
  
#### I'm a software engineer 🧑‍💻 fluent in the languages of both Android 🤳 and Web 🌐, which basically means I can talk to both robots 🤖 and aliens 👽. 


#### Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who understands the complex relationship between a bug 🐞 and a programmer 👨‍💻 – it's like a never-ending dance where  the bug leads and I try not to step on its toes.


#### But hey, at least my code has a sense of humor 😁 – it's the only explanation for all those unexpected errors, right? 🤷‍♂️
